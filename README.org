* irm

An interactive `rm`.

I often feel terrified of running large glob `rm` commands. This tool will provide you with an interactive experience, so you know you're only deleting what you want.

** Current Status

Early development, non-functional.

** To build

irm is written in clojure, and will be compiled with GraalVM for suitably fast start up times at the terminal. Please use the link in RESOURCES to get yourself set up with Graal (and native-image), then run 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh

./build.sh

#+END_SRC

to generate a new executable.

** Roadmap
*** [X] Mark and delete files [3/3]
- [X] Get TUI up and running
- [X] Display directory contents
- [X] Mark and delete files
*** DONE Tab to open directories
*** TODO Select children files
*** TODO Confirm that nested directories work
*** TODO Auto select based on regex input
*** TODO Support full command line arguments
